# KarmaWhore

KarmaWhore is a custom pack for the Guild Wars 2 addon [Reffect](https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect/) that makes it easy to keep track of your Karma buffs when you're celebrating Wintersday.

Icons for Karma buffs are displayed in two columns that can be dragged anywhere on the screen. Buffs currently active on the character are displayed at full opacity, while missing and expired buffs are greyed-out so you can quickly see what needs to be reapplied.

## Effects
Effects are loosely grouped into four sections according to expiration and availability.

![partial free crop 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04e816b6-15f0-423e-ad43-803e287b10f3)

All trackable karma buffs that apply to Wintersday activities are included except Voluteer's Blessing (map swap). These are, in order top-to-bottom, left-to-right:
* Crowd-Favorite Racer, +15% for 15 m (Complete the race in Divinity's Reach during Wintersday. Removed when you leave the instance. )
* Guild Karma Banner Boost, +15% for 30 m (Guild Karma and Experience Banner, Guild Heroes Banner)
* Spirit Banner Boost, +10% for 30 m (Spirit Banner)
* Guild Karma Boost, +10% no expiration (free from Guild Hall Bartender)
* Winters Blessing, +10% for 1 h (Reward for Wintersday daily achievement Donation Drive, aka "Orphans.")
* Community Service Tips, +10% for 1 h (New Kaineng City heart vendor buff, purchased from Elora, Lieutenant Zhao or Strigidae after completion of their respective heart.)
* 50% Karma Bonus, +50% for 1 h (Bonfire, Candy Corn Gobbler, Karma Booster, Kite Fortune, Extra Life Karma Booster)
* Candy Cane, +10% for 1-30 m (Candy Cane, stacks)
* Nourishment, +15% for 30 m (Food, Super Mixed Parfait)
* Enhancement, +10% for 30 m or 2 hr MF (Various utility consumables)

See the wiki for a [complete list of Karma buffs and sources](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Karma#Modifiers). 

Only the highest level of a boost is tracked. Some effects use alternate icons to more easily distinguish them. For example, _Guild Karma Boost_ uses the purple flask icon you see when buying it from the guild bartender.

## Limitations
The +15% amulet Enrichment cannot be tracked since it is not an _effect_. Some Wintersday events are treated as PvP instances so KarmaWhore will not display inside those instances.
