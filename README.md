# KarmaWhore

KarmaWhore is a custom pack for the Guild Wars 2 addon [Reffect](https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect/) that makes it easy to keep track of your Karma buffs when you're celebrating Wintersday.

Icons for Karma buffs are displayed in two columns that can be dragged anywhere on the screen. Buffs currently active on the character are displayed at full opacity, while missing and expired buffs are greyed-out so you can quickly see what needs to be reapplied.

## Effects
Effects are loosely grouped into four sections according to expiration and availability.

See the wiki for a [complete list of Karma buffs and sources](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Karma#Modifiers). 

Only the highest level of a boost is tracked. Some effects use alternate icons to more easily distinguish them. For example, _Guild Karma Boost_ uses the purple flask icon you see when buying it from the guild bartender.

## Limitations
* The +15% amulet Enrichment cannot be tracked since it is not an _effect_ 
* Some Wintersday events are treated as PvP instances so KarmaWhore will not display inside those instances
* Only the highest (15%) food buff is tracked (some foods give a 10% karma buff)
