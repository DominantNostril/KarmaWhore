KarmaWhore is a custom pack for the Guild Wars 2 addon [Reffect](https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect/) that makes it easy to keep track of your Karma buffs when you're celbrating Wintersday.

Icons for Karma buffs are displayed in two columns that can be dragged anywhere on the screen. Buffs currently active on the character are displayed at full opacity, while missing and expired buffs are greyed-out so you can quickly see what needs to be reapplied.

Some Wintersday events are treated as PvP instances so KarmaWhore will not display inside those instances.

More documentation coming soon. Refer to the [Magic Finder readme](https://github.com/DominantNostril/MagicFinder) for analagous documentation.
